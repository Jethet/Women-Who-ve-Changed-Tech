        "Bio": {
            "Summary": "The daughter of famed poet Lord Byron, Augusta Ada Byron, Countess of Lovelace — better known as \"Ada Lovelace\" — showed her gift for mathematics at an early age. She translated an article on an invention by Charles Babbage, and added her own comments. Because she introduced many computer concepts, Lovelace is considered the first computer program",

        "Legacy": "Lovelace's contributions to the field of computer science were not discovered until the 1950s. Her notes were reintroduced to the world by B.V. Bowden, who republished them in 'Faster Than Thought - A Symposium on Digital Computing Machines'. Since then, Ada has received many posthumous honors for her work.",

She continued to work in computing after the war, leading the team that created the first computer language compiler, which led to the popular COBOL language. She resumed active naval service at the age of 60, becoming a rear admiral before retiring in 1986.",

In addition to her programming accomplishments, Hopper's legacy includes encouraging young people to learn how to program. The Grace Hopper Celebration of Women In Computing Conference is a technical conference that encourages women to become part of the world of computing, while the Association for Computing Machinery offers a Grace Murray Hopper Award.
